# ForkHub [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.forkhub)

The official [GitHub Android App](https://github.com/github/android/) hasn't been updated in a while and has been accumulating a few bugs and missing features, so I've decided to fork it and keep improving it.

I'll start by merging bug fixes that have been lying around for months, and once I'm comfortable again with the state of the app, I'd like to start adding new features.

You can see a comprehensive list of changes made to the original app in the [change log](https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues) section to
