# ForkHub [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.forkhub) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonanp/ForkHub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonanp/ForkHub)

The official [GitHub Android App](https://github.com/github/android/) hasn't been updated in a while and has been accumulating a few bugs and missing features, so I've decided to fork it and keep improving it.

I'll start by merging bug fixes that have been lying around for months, and once I'm comfortable again with the state of the app, I'd like to start adding new features.

You can see a comprehensive list of changes made to the original app in the [change log](https://github.com/jonanp/ForkHub/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/jonanp/ForkHub/issues) section to

## Building

### With Gradle

The easiest way to build is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) v1.+
with [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/) v2.2.1.
Once installed, then you can import the project into Android Studio:

1. Open `File`
2. Import Project
3. Select `build.gradle` under the project directory
4. Click `OK`

Then, Gradle will do everything for you.
